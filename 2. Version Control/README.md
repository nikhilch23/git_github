## Version Control System - VCS

### What is VCS and Why do we need it?

* Version control software keeps track of every modification to the source code in a special kind of database.
* If a mistake has made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix that mistake.
* Especially useful when a project is being handled by a team usually in large code bases.
* Examples for VCS- Git, Mercurial, SVN and many more.


### What would happen without VCS and What will happen without VCS?

1. Make a copy of that file/folder once you made a new version.
2. Disadvatage of this is that it takes a lot of memory and the project will have a really bad structure.

### Types of Version Control Systems: CVCS and DVCS

1. Centralized Version Control System
	* The code is at a centre hub and all others access it from there.
	* If the central code get lost, the code get lost from all the linked computers.

2. Distributed Version Control System.
	* The central code is distributed  to all the cloned repositories.
	* If the central code get lost, the others will still have access to the code through their clones.


### Git over other Version Controls?

1. Git has manual saving.
2. Git is distributed.
3. Keeps everything using least memory.

### Where will git be used?

1. All the major Open source projects are hosted on GitHub. As the name says it's the hub of projects tracked using git. We hope you've understood the difference between git and GitHub by now.
2. Google Summer of Code, Rails Girls Summer of Code, Kharagpur Winter of Code and all Open source projects.

3. Here the code is made public for people to see and is much more interactive. It enhances the community interaction.
