# Let's start your journey with GIT !!

### 1. Creating a local repository. (Git command: git -init)
- Create a new folder (my-project).
- Use cd command to go to newly created folder.
- Type the following command:
{% highlight ruby %}
git -init
{% endhighlight %}
This will create a .git file in the directory with a basic skeleton without any commits.
