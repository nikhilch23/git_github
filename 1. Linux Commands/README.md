* `ls` : List of file in the current folder
* `ls -a` : Gives the list of all the files(including the hidden files as well)
* `mv` : Moves or renames a file
* `touch` : touch <filename.txt>  Used to create a new file in the directory
* `cat` : cat <filename.txt> Used to display the contents of the file on the terminal.


### Why is Linux preferred over Windows?

* Open source nature:
> What is it like when you buy a car, but you cannot see what’s under the hood? Similar is the case with when you use a Windows-powered system.

> However, in contrast, Linux is completely an open source project. You can have a look at the source code of a Linux OS, which is a plus.

* Secure:
> Windows OS is vulnerable to different types of attacks (or hacks). However, Linux is not as vulnerable as Windows. It sure isn’t invulnerable, but it is a lot more secure. Although, there’s no rocket science in it.

* Can revive older computers:
> As the operating systems evolve, so do their hardware requirements increase exponentially. For instance, if you purchase a genuine copy of Windows 10, you will have to meet the minimum hardware requirements to run it successfully, and you cannot run it on just about any low-end system.

* Perfect For Programmers
> GNU/Linux is a Unix-like OS. It has a huge collection of programs which makes your command line lit. It can increase your programming speed to a great extend. Comes with most of the things installed by default. All the configurations can be easily done using certain package managers. You don't have to make your hands dirty and waste huge amount of time in just installing and configuring programs to make them work.

* Software Updates
> You'll be getting regular software updates and bug fixes. Even when you mess something up, you can send an error report to get it fixed soon. Unlike Windows or other proprietary operating systems, it has a huge community support.

* Many more
> It comes with better privacy management, customisations, freedom, huge number of distros depending upon your needs, etc.

### What is Open source?

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.

"Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly.
