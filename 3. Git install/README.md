* Git is a DVCS.
* GitHub hosts a large number of OS projects that are tracked using git. Even git itself.

### Services which GitHub provides:

1. GitHub student pack. (Use your institute mail id to sign up)
2. GitHub pages.  


### Starting with git:


1. You can verify your git installation correctly by printing it's version number. Check this command `git --version`

2. After you've installed git properly, it's time to set some variables for the git configuration. You've to do this only once. Follow the commands on terminal.

	* `git config --global user.name "ABC"`
	* `git config --global user.email "abc.iitkgp@gmail.com"`
	* `git config --global http.proxy http://172.16.2.30:8080`      // Setting system.proxy in git

3. Now check `git config --list` to know you've set the variables correctly.



Congratulations, you've git up and running on your computer. Now, it's time to start learning git.
